#Pokemon Pet Project

Since I was a kid I've always loved Pokemon. I have a pretty deep understanding of the game's mechanics, so I wanted to challenge myself to put those mechanics into code
and see if I could recreate a fundamental pokemon experience. The implementation mostly applies to Pokemon battles, which are the most mechanically intensive part of
the game. I hope to use this code and my ideas to create a full stack application that simulates Pokemon battles someday. I've learned a lot so far and I'm excited to
keep learning as I build on this code.
